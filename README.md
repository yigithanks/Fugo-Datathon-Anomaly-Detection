# Fugo-Datathon-Anomaly-Detection

**Univariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection for KPIs**

**Description:** Implemented an anomaly detection system for a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dataset sampled every minute over a span of approximately three months. The dataset exhibits its own trends, seasonality, and inherent anomalies, along with some noise.

**Objective:** The goal of the project was to identify unexpected values within the datasetâ€”those that deviate significantly from the prevailing characteristics. 

By leveraging time-series analysis techniques, the developed anomaly detection system facilitates the early identification of unusual events. This early detection enables timely intervention, proving crucial in preventing or mitigating potential issues and risks.
